# csharp-lessons

The 'csharp-lessons' repository is a repository I use in a series of programming lessons for my son.  

As new concepts are learned (taught) then a small project accompanies the lesson.  The code in this repo is an
example of the end result.

The end goal is to move into game development using a framework like MonoGame or Unity.

## Project/Lesson Requirements
The lessons are using Visual Studio 2019 Community edition with .NET 5 as the framework.

Any other standard editor or IDE can also be used.
