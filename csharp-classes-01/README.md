# csharp-classes-01
The 'csharp-classes-01' is the first 'lesson' on classes in a series of programming lessons for my son.  

## Project/Lesson Requirements
Create a ```Car``` class that contains the following properties:
1. Make (string)
2. Model (string)
3. Colour (string)
4. Price (decimal)

Create a method inside the class that returns a string that contains all the information in narrative form, like:

Instantiate three instances of the car class, set the properties of each instance individually and then write a formatted output of each car information to the console similar to:

```
The car is a blue Mazda CX-3 and costs $28000
The car is a yellow Toyota Kluger and costs $35000
The car is a red Ford Fiesta and costs $8000 
```

### Components/Constructs
Make use of the following constructs/language features:
- ```class``` - defines the class
- Properties that uses  ```get; set;``` 
- Method that outputs the formatted car details

### Optional Extras
- Use a method inside the ```Car``` class to output the car information 
- Use a constructor to set the property values (instead of setting each property individually)
- Use an object initialiser to set the property values (instead of setting each property individually, or instead of using the constructor)
