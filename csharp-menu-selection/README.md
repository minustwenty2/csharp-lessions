# csharp-menu-selection
The 'csharp-menu-selection' is the fourth 'lesson' in a series of programming lessons for my son.

The aim of this lesson and associated project is to get more familiar with ```switch``` statements.

## Project/Lesson Requirements
Write a C# console program that shows a list of menu options and ask the user to make a selection.  
Output the customer's selection as confirmation of order (only one selection to be made).
 
### Example 
1. Chicken burger
2. Hamburger
3. Fish and chips
4. Potato salad

Please enter your selection (number): 

You selected "Potato salad" - have a great day.

### Components/Constructs
Make use of the following constructs/language features:
- ```Console.ReadLine()``` - gets input from the user
- ```Console.WriteLine()``` - writes output to the console
- ```switch``` - to determine selection

### Optional Extra
Use a switch expression instead of a standard switch statement to determine the selected menu option.
