# csharp-largest-number-02
The 'csharp-largest-number' is the second 'lesson' in a series of programming lessons for my son.  

As new concepts are learned (taught) then a small project accompanies the lesson.  The code here is an
example of the end result.

## Project/Lesson Requirements
Write a C# console program that asks the user to enter three numbers, calculate the greatest (biggest)
of the three and display the greatest one.

### Example 
If the user entered 34, 5, 27 then the result must be: "The number 34 is the greatest"

### Components/Constructs
Make use of the following constructs/language features:
- ```Console.ReadLine()``` - gets input from the user
- ```Console.WriteLine()``` - writes output to the console
- ```int[]``` - integer array
- ```for``` loop to calculate the largest number

The following components are optional:
- ```foreach``` - loop to calculate the largest number
- ```Array.Sort()``` - using an array sort to get the largest number
