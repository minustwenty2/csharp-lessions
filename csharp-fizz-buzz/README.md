# csharp-fizz-buzz
The 'csharp-fizz-buzz' is the third 'lesson' in a series of programming lessons for my son.  

## Project/Lesson Requirements
Write a C# console program that loops from 1 to 100 (both inclusive) and for each number does the following:
- if the number is divisible by 3 then output "fizz"
- if the number is divisible by 5 then output "buzz"
- if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 then out "fizzbuzz" **only** (do not output 'fizz', 'buzz' and 'fizzbuzz')
- if the number is not divisible by 3 or 5 then just output the number

### Example 
1 2 fizz 4 buzz .......

### Components/Constructs
Make use of the following constructs/language features:
- ```Console.ReadLine()``` - gets input from the user
- ```Console.WriteLine()``` - writes output to the console
- ```for``` - loop from 1 to 100
- ```%``` - modus operator to see if the number is divisible by "3" or "5"
